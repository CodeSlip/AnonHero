Telling the story and proving that it happened

This application was built in a weekend by Tiffany Marroquin, Anthony Albertoria, Michael Cohen, & Jason Tissera.
It uses Torus for secure sign-in, and the Skale EVM, storage, and ML, for processing, storage and image validation.
The purpose of this platform is to help anyone tell their story, and unequivocally prove it on the blockchain, while protecting their identity.

## Pre-requisites
Set-up Torus with a custom RPC endpoint:
