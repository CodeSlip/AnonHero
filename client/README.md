## AnonHero

### Telling the story and proving it happened.

We built AnonHero to allow people to tell their story and *prove* that it happened.

Built on Skale, Torus, Truffle and React, AnonHero leverages the power of seamless decentralized identity and elastic sidechains to create local community.

To run AnonHero, run ```npm install``` and ```npm start```.
